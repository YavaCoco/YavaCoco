# Introduction
Heey!

I am Yava, a high schooler from Morocco who loves programming day and night.

I am fascinated by the way computers work, hence, most of my programming projects have to do with low level stuff involving thinking like a machine. During the years I have been programming(almost 7 now!), I have worked on many personal projects, most of which ended up forgotten and not complete, but left me with a lot of knowledge and experience, that I want to use to make my current (real) projects as perfect as can be.

# My current projects
  - [HeliumOs](https://github.com/YavaCoco/HeliumOS): An operating system, my try to make OSs the way I want them to be, the project was rewritten multiple times, and never got past the point of broken memory management, but I have lots of hope that I will eventually complete it, it's funny to note that 90% of my projects the last three years had something to do with Helium.
  - [Hydrogen](https://github.com/YavaCoco/Hydrogen): A programming language that seeks to be as holy as C, but as cool as C++. The idea was to keep the elements of C++ that were compatible with the functional programming paradigm, it can be thought of as: Hydrogen = C++ - objects, or C + namespaces + templates + private struct members, all with a python like syntax cuz you can't debate that it is the best syntax there is. I was initally planning on writing Helium with it, but I don't know about that for sure, or at least, I'll be gradually rewritting parts of Helium in it. A working lexer is as far as I got to this point.

# Projects from the past that I am still proud of
  - [DotCVM](https://github.com/YavaCoco/DotCVM): This was the product of 2 years ago me finding paging in x86 architectures too hard to learn, so I went ahead and created an architecture that doesn't use paging. DotCVM was probably the first project that I actually completed until its end, and while the code isn't really clean to my standards today, this project still gets the reward of **First completed serious project**, and the cool thing is that at the end of it, I started understanding why paging is useful, and how it works.
  - [ShellBuildSystem](https://github.com/YavaCoco/ShellBuildSystem): And this was the product of half a year ago me not understanding how `make` works, so I went ahead and wrote a whole build system in bash. The name is really awkward, since 1) Shell doesn't mean what I thought it does, and the build system is written in bash anyway, and 2) The name makes it sound like we are building a project written in shell, while it wuilt projects written in C/C++/Asm. HeliumOs was built using this for a period of time, and to be honest I still use it from time to time whenever I have a small project. I give it the rewards of **Actually a useful thing** and **Bro just learn make instead of spending three days writing a build system**. The thing I really loved doing in this project is make it install and update itself.
  - [Karnet](https://github.com/YavaCoco/Karnet): This is an android app that I made because someone I know irl requested it. The repo wasn't supposed to be public, but I had to make it so so that I can pull updates of the app from github(and now the stupid me just realised I could've created another repo to push the apks in smh). Anyway, it is a very useless project for anyone else really, but I give all credit of my knowledge about andoird app dev to this app, since it's the only one I wrote.
